    <!-- FORMS IN HTML -->

    <!-- 
        Forms can take many...wait for it...forms!
        Can be a simple login, a registration form
        Anything where the user's data is being collected and
            dealt with in some way


        We can have the user fill in important information
            - name
            - birthday
            - SSN
            - phone
            - email

        We can also have them select/input other information
            via non-typing means
            - buttons
            - checkboxes
            - color selectors

        We use different types of tag to collect different types
            of information
            - form
            - buttons
            - input
            - label
            - select

        The <input> tag is critical and can take on many types
            - text
            - date
            - number
            - color
            - email
            - radio buttons
            - checkboxes
            - file uploads

        At the end of the form process, the user will submit the form
        
        ONLY inputs WITHIN the form tag 
        will be submitted with the form
     -->

    <!-- A form tag has two important attributes:
            - method
            - action
     -->

    <!-- CRUD operations
        these are the basic operations we use with databases

        C = create
        R = read
        U = update
        D = delete

        C is done with a ____ request
        R is done with a ____ request
        U is done with a ____ request
        D is done with a ____ request

        form's method property deals with ___ and ___

        ___ - the form-data will be transmitted as part of the url's request parameters
                localhost:5500/forms.html?name=Erica&favorite-food=apples

        ___ - the form-data will be transmitted as part of the http request's body
              by default html forms use application/x-www-form-urlencoded  
              which is similar to json
                
                    name: "Erica",
                    favoriteFood: "apples"
                
    
    -->
    <!-- XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX -->
    <!-- EXAMPLE 1: MAKE A FORM THAT  makes a GET request to Google
         GET says "give me the resource in the action property" -->
    <form method="" action="http://google.com">

        <!-- All other previous tags are still relevant in a form -->
        <p>GET form -- Go to Google.com/search?name=___</p>
        <input type="" name="" placeholder="">

        <!-- Add a button tag to submit the form, 
                - - Add the attribute type="submit"  -- tells the form to send a GET request when clicked
                - - Add the text for the button to display
             -->
        <button type=""></button>
        <button type=""></button>

        <!-- Notice, not all characters are allowed in urls, because they have special meanings or could be misinterpretted
                so some characters get encoded, for example
                space = %20
                ! = %21
                " = %22
                # = %23
                $ = %24
                % = %25
                & = %26
                ' = %27
                ( = %28
                ) = %29
                * = %2A
                + = %2B
                , = %2C
                - = %2D
                . = %2E
                / = %2F
                < = %3C
                > = %3E
                ? = %3F
                @ = %40
                © = %A9
                ® = %AE
