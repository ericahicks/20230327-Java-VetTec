Workflow
--------
1. clone 
   -- WARNING: only clone ONCE (This can be anywhere on your computer)
   -- then just import into your eclipse workspace
   -- Then in GitHub Desktop use the add repository from existing repository
       DONT clone again
2. branch
3. develop code constantly do 

   git status 
   git add . 
   git commit -m "specific message about your changes"
   git push origin yourbranch

4. regularly merge the most recent code into your branch:

   git pull 
   git checkout yourbranchname 
   git merge main

5. DO NOT PUSH DIRECTLY TO MAIN, create a pull request
   GitHub > Pull Requests > Add Pull Request > select main <-- yourbranch

Daily (or however often your team chooses)
1. Make a pull request on github
2. If there are merge conflicts, resolve them locally and push your code again until the pull request on GitHub turns green

Resolve
1. Go into your development environment
2. Open git bash or any commandline and run 
     git fetch
     git merge 
to get the most recent version of the code
3. Get those changes into your local branch ****
      

TODO
GitHub Desktop: 
- Go to the Branches Tab 
  --- all the way at the bottom is a button [choose a branch to merge into currentbranchname] 
- Select main, it will either automatically merge, or automatically create to show you where to resolve conflicts
HEAD>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

=========================

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<otherbranch
- Save and commit your changes to complete the merge (or press complete on the merge window in GitHub Desktop)
