Compiling and running classes on the command line when working with a package structure

Step 1: Compile within the src/com/skillstorm/ directory where your .java file exists
  specify the destination
        myproj
          >bin(**) want my .class files here
          >src
            >com 
              >skillstorm(*) currently inside of here, I can compile using
                -Hello.java 
                -Test.java
command line would be
> javac -d ../../../bin Hello.java
>

Step 2: To run the class, we must use the package and classname, so from inside bin
specify the full class name
        myproj (*) currently inside of here
          >bin
            >com 
              >skillstorm
                -Hello.class (**) This is the file I want to run
          >src
            >com 
              >skillstorm
                -Hello.java 
                -Test.java
command line would be from where our package structure starts
>java com.skillstorm.Hello
>
