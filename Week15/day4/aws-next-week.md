# AWS

You should have received two emails
  - SkillStorm's AWS account (you can also play around with the free tier using your own personal accounts if you want more access than our student account gives)
  - Study material for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification Exam 

We will be using
  - RDS = Relational Database Service
  - EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud (spring boot web server REST API) -- maven build to get the .jar file
  - S3 = Simple Storage Service (angular front end) -- ng build to get the dist folder to put in the s3 bucket

Resources to study more about these cloud concepts before next week:
  - Skillbuilder
     - courses: Cloud Quest (40hrs education game)
                Cloud Practitioner Essentials (6hrs) -- focus on the EC2 section, the RDS section, S3 section
                EC2 Basics (50min) 
                etc.


TODO
- setup our RDS connection in MySQL workbench
- build our projects to make a jar we can use later (rt click run as maven install) what application.props do you want it to use dev or prd?
- build our angular project (ng build )what environemtn do you want it to use dev or prod?
