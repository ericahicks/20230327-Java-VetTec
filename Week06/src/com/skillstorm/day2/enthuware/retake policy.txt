Retake Policy:
- Oracle requires you wait 5 days or a week to schedule your retake

SkillStorm's policy:
- Will pay for one retake if needed and you can demonstrate improvement 
- DO NOT HAVE TO take the exam Friday if you have not scored in the 60s yet
   - You can expect to do slightly better on the actual exam
   - DO try to take it in the next week or so to be ready for the OCA material (Oracle certified associate, Jun 2nd goal)
